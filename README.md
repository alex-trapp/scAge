# scAge

scAge is a probabilistic framework for profiling epigenetic age at single-cell resolution, developed in Python. <br> <br>
This tool leverages the relationship between DNA methylation in bulk samples and chronological age to perform
probability-based profiling of epigenetic age in intrinsically sparse and binarized single-cell data. <br> <br>
This approach constitutes the first single-cell clock method, and is both highly scalable and flexible. <br> <br> 
It can be used on any number of cells and can be trained on any methylation-age dataset. <br> <br>
To learn more about the underlying algorithms driving scAge, please consult the [Trapp et al. preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.13.435247v1).

```

## Installation
To install scAge and associated data, please download or clone the GitHub repository:

`git clone https://github.com/alex-trapp/scAge.git`

This will download all required data to utilize and test the software. <br>

For ease of use, all functions needed to run the full scAge pipeline are directly included within scAge.py

## Usage

To run scAge, first add the directory containing scAge.py to your path, then import scAge into a Python script or Jupyter notebook:

```
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/dir') # where dir contains scAge.py
import scAge
```

In order to use the functions provided in scAge, the following packages need to be installed:

`numpy` (developed with version 1.20.2) <br>
`pandas` (developed with version 1.2.4) <br>
`scipy` (developed with version 1.6.3) <br>
`sklearn` (developed with version 0.24.2) <br>
`tqdm` (developed with version 4.60.0) <br>

We also recommend installing `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and `statannot` to visualize epigenetic age predictions in Python.<br>
Predicted epigenetic age output files are written as .tsv files, and can therefore also be analyzed in any other environment (i.e. R).

scAge is a workflow that enables epigenetic age prediction in single cells using a combination of linear models to estimate age.

3 example Jupyter notebooks detailing how to use the scAge tool are provided in the `notebooks` directory: <br>
* `process_coverage_notebook.ipynb` --> processing .cov/.cov.gz files from Bismark into filtered binary methylation matrices <br>
* `construct_reference_notebook.ipynb` --> constructing a reference set of linear models from a bulk methylation matrix <br>
* `example_run_scAge_notebook.ipynb` --> predicting epigenetic age in single cells <br>

These notebooks use all the single cells from the [Gravina et al. 2016 study](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1011-3),
described in Figure 2 of our manuscript. <br>
Required data to run these example scripts is provided:
* Raw .cov files of single-cell methylomes are located in `sc_data_raw`
* Processed binary methylation matrices (produced by running `process_coverage` on raw .cov.gz files) are located in `sc_data_processed`
* Raw bulk data for liver used to construct reference models is located in `bulk`
* Processed reference matrices (produced by running `construct_reference` on raw bulk DNAm data) for liver, blood, and a multi-tissue dataset are located in `train`

The functions driving scAge are explained and documented below, as well as deeply documented in the source code of scAge.py. <br>
Default values for parameters in all functions are shown (i.e. `n_cores = 30`). The best values for some parameters (`n_cores`, `chunksize`)
will depend on your hardware specifications. I recommend setting all the parameters for all functions to ensure intended functionality.

## Data

All data from this study is publicly available from the [GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) <br>
The table below summarize where the processed methylation data can be obtained:

Study | GEO Accession |
:---: | :---: |
[Angermueller et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3728) | [GSE68642](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68642) |
[Hernando-Herraez et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12293-4) | [GSE121436](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE121436) |
[Smallwood et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3035) | [GSE56879](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE56879) |

In the case of the [Gravina et al. 2016](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1011-3), no deposition of processed methylation data was made to GEO. I downloaded trimmed FASTQ files from SRA (accession [SRA344045](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?query_key=2&WebEnv=MCID_60c66f07420f4367b31414c9&o=acc_s%3Aa)) using the `fasterq-dump` from the SRA Toolkit and mapped them the mm10/GRCm38.p6 genome using [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) v0.22.3 with the option `â€“non_directional`, as suggested by the [Bismark User Guide v0.21.0](https://rawgit.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/master/Docs/Bismark_User_Guide.html) for Zymo Pico-Methyl scWGBS library preparations. Reads were subsequently deduplicated and methylation levels for CpG sites were extracted with Bismark.


## Training
CpG-specific linear models are first calculated using a reference bulk methylation matrix, which may contain some missing values.
From our findings so far, using single tissue or single cell-type datasets is preferred to improve prediction accuracy,
although multi-tissue datasets may also be used for training with reasonable predictive accuracy.

I provide pre-computed liver, blood, and multi-tissue training reference datasets for C57BL/6J mice inside of the `train` directory.

In order to train a custom set of linear models from a given DNAm matrix, run:

```
construct_reference(training_DNAm_matrix,
                    output_path,
                    n_cores = 30,
                    chunksize = 100)
```

where:
* `training_DNAm_matrix` --> input bulk methylation matrix <br>
* `output_path` --> desired full path to the output reference matrix (/path/to/file.tsv) <br>
* `n_cores` --> number of cores to use via parallel processing <br>
* `chunksize` --> number of individual CpG methylation series to distribute at once to each worker <br>

This function takes as input a pandas dataframe DNAm matrix, with rows as samples and columns as CpGs (in the form chr9_85324737). <br>
Methylation values must be in the range from 0 (fully unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). <br>
This dataframe must also contain an "Age" column, which is used to compute correlations and linear regressions. <br>
An example bulk matrix of C57BL/6J mice livers is provided in the `bulk` directory <br>


## Loading single-cell methylomes
scAge requires binary methylation matrices as input for the core epigenetic age profiling algorithm. These binary matrices can be obtained
by processing existing .cov files produced by [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) with our function
`process_coverage`. However, there are other tools to process FASTQ bisulfite sequencing data, such as [BSSeeker](https://github.com/BSSeeker/BSseeker2) and [methylpy](https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy). Therefore, final single-cell methylome files may have slightly different formats depending on the tool used. The Bismark .cov file format is the following (the columns are not named in the files):

Chromosome | Position 1 | Position 2 | Methylation level | Methylated counts | Unmethylated counts
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: 
11 | 3100225 | 3100225 | 100 | 1 | 0
11 | 3101286 | 3101286 | 0 | 0 | 2

Native support for a variety of input formats will be added shortly. For now, I recommend processing single-cell methylation data with [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) or converting existing methylation data to a Bismark format (shown above). <br> <br>

Most of the publicly available data used in our study were in the .cov format, including data from [Hernando-Herraez et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12293-4), [Angermueller et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3728) and [Smallwood et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3035). The sequencing data from the [Gravina et al.](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1011-3) study was also processed via the Bismark pipeline. Processed methylation data from the [Argelaguet et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1825-8) 
contained the same information as .cov files, but the columns were labeled and in a different order. These files were handled separately to produce
the required format for scAge. <br><br>

Ultimately, scAge requires a .tsv file or pandas datraframe formatted with two columns, shown below. <br><br>
`ChrPos` should be in the form chr_position (i.e. chr1_3037802), while `MetLev` should be binary (0 or 1).

ChrPos | MetLev
:---: | :---:
chr1_3037802 | 1
chr19_61305429 | 0
... | ...

To load and process .cov files generated by Bismark, run:

```
process_coverage(cov_directory, 
                 n_cores = 10,
                 max_met = 100,
                 split = ".",
                 chunksize = 1,
                 binarization = "round",
                 output_path = None):
```

where:
* `cov_directory` --> path to the directory where .cov single-cell methylation files are stored <br>
* `n_cores` --> number of cores to use for parallel processing <br>
* `maxmet` --> maximum methylation value (normally, methylation ratios of Bismark-generated files range from 0 to 100) <br>
* `split` --> desired string to split the file name on for single-cell name generation (if split is ".", then "SRR3136624.cov" becomes "SRR3136624") <br>
* `chunksize` --> number of coverage files that will be fed into a single worker process at a time <br>
* `binarization` --> choice of `round` vs. `discard`
                   Both methods involve dropping methylation values of 0.5
                   `round` rounds remaining non-binary values to 0 or 1 (this is the default), while
                   `discard` discards remaining non-binary values <br>
* `output_path` --> the full path to the output directory in which processed .tsv binary matrices should be written in
If `output_path` is set to `None`, named binary methylation matrices are returned in the form of a dictionary of pandas DataFrames <br>

### Predicting epigenetic age
The core of scAge is run_scAge, a function that enables epigenetic age predictions from a previously processed set of binarized single-cell
methylome profiles and a reference regression matrix generated from bulk data (ideally from the same tissue). To run this function:

```
scAge.run_scAge(single_cell_dir_or_dict,
                single_cell_set_name,
                reference_data,
                selection_mode = "percentile",
                CpG_parameter = 1,
                zero_met_replacement = 0.001,
                one_met_replacement = 0.999,
                min_age = -20,
                max_age = 60,
                age_step = 0.1,
                n_cores = 3,
                uncertainty = 1,
                output_path = None,
                chunksize = 1)
```

where:
* `single_cell_dir_or_dict` --> full path to a directory OR a dictionary of processed single-cell methylomes, created with `process_coverage`
* `single_cell_set_name` --> desired name of the scAge run (i.e. 'dataset_x')
* `reference_data` --> full path to the reference regression matrix created with `create_reference`
* `selection_mode` --> one of `percentile` (default), `numCpGs`, `cutoff`, which determines which CpG selection mode should be used in the algorithm.
I recommend `percentile` mode, which selects the most highly-correlated CpGs while accounting for differential coverage between cells. Alternatively,
a defined number of CpGs can be chosen using `numCpGs` mode, or a cutoff based on Pearson correlation can be set with `cutoff` 
(where only CpGs with |r| â‰¥ threshold are selected for the algorithm).
* `CpG_parameter` --> parameter accompanying selection mode 
(1 in percentile mode --> top 1% age-correlated CpGs) <br>
(500 in numCpGs mode --> top 500 age-correlated CpGs) <br>
(0.7 in cutoff mode --> top age-correlated CpGs with |r| â‰¥ 0.7) <br>
* `zero_met_replacement1` --> if the linear model built on bulk data goes below 0 for a given age, this value replaces the probability
* `one_met_replacement` --> if the linear model built on bulk data goes below 0 for a given age, this value replaces the probability
* `min_age` --> minimum age for probability computations
* `max_age` --> maximum age for probability computations
* `age_step` --> step for probability computations (i.e. if age_step == 1, likelihoods will be calculated for every 1 month between `min_age` and `max_age`)
* `n_cores` --> number of cores that should be used for parallel processing
* `uncertainty` --> the uncertainty metric that should be used to compute upper and lower bounds (higher value result in a wider interval)
* `output_path` --> full path to the directory where predictions and the report file should be written to
* `chunksize` --> number of single-cell methylomes that should be passed to each parallel worker at once

The output of run_scAge is a .tsv matrix, which contains a number of columns detailing the internal computations of the algorithm.
The leftmost columns are the most critical, including: 
* `PredictedAge` --> scDNAm epigenetic age predictions in the units of the training data (in our case, months)
* `MeanMet` --> mean global methylation of the single cell (which we show is related to epigenetic age in some cell types)
* `CellCoverage` --> number of CpGs covered in the single cell (which can be used to filter predictions based on low coverage)

An example output file is shown below:

Cell | PredictedAge | MeanMet | CellCoverage | ... |
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
SRR3136627 | 0.5 | 0.663169 | 3914949 | ... |
SRR3136659 | 4.0 | 0.683454 | 799350 | ... |
SRR3136628 | 25.0 | 0.695256 | 2511084 | ... |
